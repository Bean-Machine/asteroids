A simple Asteroids-style game originally written in **Python (Tkinter)** and later ported to **JavaScript (HTML/CSS)** to run directly in a web browser.

## 📝 About

I created this project as part of teaching myself programming from scratch.  
It began as an object-oriented Python implementation using Tkinter. After discovering performance bottlenecks, I refactored it into a purely procedural design using dictionaries and standalone functions — which significantly improved performance.

Later, to strengthen my JavaScript skills, I ported the game to a browser version using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
